## Logic Prompt
**Prompt:** *If I put a coin in a cup and put the cup in the freezer, is the coin wet or dry? Explain step by step.*

```
Let's break it down:

1. **Initial state**: You start with a coin (presumably made of metal, such as copper or nickel) that is dry.
2. **You place the coin in a cup**: The coin remains dry and is now contained within the cup.
3. **You put the cup with the coin in the freezer**: Now we get to the interesting part! When you place the cup with the coin in the freezer, the temperature of both the cup and the coin will decrease rapidly. However, this change in temperature does not affect the state (wet or dry) of the coin.
4. **What happens when the coin is exposed to a cold environment?**: In a cold environment like a freezer, any condensation that might have occurred on the surface of the coin (if it were previously moist or humid) would likely freeze solid. However, since we started with a dry coin, there is no moisture present to freeze.
5. **Conclusion**: The coin remains dry. The cold temperature does not change its state from dry to wet; it simply maintains its original condition.

In summary, the coin will remain dry when placed in a cup and then frozen in a freezer, as there was no initial moisture on or within the coin to freeze.
