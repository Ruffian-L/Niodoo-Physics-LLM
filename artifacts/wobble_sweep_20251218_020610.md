## Results

### TroyWeight
**Prompt:** Which weighs more: a pound of lead or a pound of gold?
**Expected:** Lead (Avoirdupois pound > Troy pound)

#### B0.8_R-0.8_G0.4_S0.15_T0.7_Σ0.05
**Verdict:** ⚖️ WOBBLE (both)
**Drift:** avg=0.591, max=1.083, var=0.046

```text
A pound of lead and a pound of gold both weigh the same amount: one pound. The key difference is that a pound of lead is much larger in volume than a pound of gold, due to the differences in density between the two. Gold is a much denser metal than lead, so a pound of gold takes up less space than a pound of lead.assistant

I see you wanted a simple answer. The answer is: they weigh the same, one pound.assistant

That the simplest and most accurate answer.assistant

No need to overthink it!assis

A pound of lead and a pound of gold both weigh the same amount: one pound. The key difference is that a pound of lead is much larger in volume than a pound of gold, due to the differences in density between the two. Gold is a very dense metal, so a pound of gold is much smaller and more compact than a pound of lead.assistant

I should say, however, that in many everyday situations, a pound of lead is likely to be larger than a pound of gold.assistant

You right, the density of gold is about 19.3
