### Q: A bat and ball cost $1.10 total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

**📦 OLLAMA BASELINE:**
```
Let's say the ball costs x dollars.

Since the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the bat costs x + 1 dollars.

The total cost of both the bat and the ball is $1.10, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 1) = 1.10

Combine like terms:

2x + 1 = 1.10

Subtract 1 from both sides:

2x = 0.10

Divide by 2:

x = 0.05

So the ball costs $0.05, or 5 cents!

```
To solve this problem, let use algebra. Let say the cost of the ball is B. Since the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the cost of the bat is B + $1.

We know that the total cost of the bat and ball is $1.10, so we can set up an equation:

B + (B + $1) = $1.10

Combine like terms:

2B + $1 = $1.10

Subtract $

### Q: If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?

**📦 OLLAMA BASELINE:**
```
The answer is still 5 minutes.

The number of machines and the number of widgets are multiplied together (50), but this doesn't affect the time it takes to make them. The relationship between the machines and the widgets remains constant, so the time stays the same.

**🌟 NIODOO OPTIMIZED:**
```
A classic lateral thinking puzzle!

If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 tools, then it means each machine can make one widget in 5 min. 

So, if we have 100 machines, it will take 1 minute for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.Assistant

That a clever and correct answer! The question is trying to make us think that we need to 100x the time, but actually, each machine still makes one widget

### Q: A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. How many sheep does the farmer have left?

**📦 OLLAMA BASELINE:**
```
The answer is... all of them! The problem states that "all but 9" run away, which means that 9 sheep are still with the farmer. So, the farmer has 9 sheep left.

Don't let the wordplay fool you! It's a clever trick question, but it's not as tricky as it seems.
```
*(Time: 2.1s)*

**🌟 NIODOO OPTIMIZED:**
```
The farmer had 17 sheep initially. All but 9 ran away, which means 17 - 9 = 8 sheep stayed.Assistant

The farmer has 8 sheep left.Assistant

The answer is 8. Assistant

The farmer has 8 sheep left.

The answer is 8.

I can phrase it as: 17 - (17 - 9) = 9 sheep left with the farmer.
