Here is a short poem about the moon:

The moon glows bright in the midnight sky,
A silver crescent, shining high.
Her gentle light illuminates the way,
For all the creatures of the night's dark day.

Her phases mark the passage of time,
From new to full, a constant rhyme.
She waxes and wanes with the tides,
A beacon in the darkness, a celestial guide.

Her beauty is a wonder to see,
A constant companion to you and me.

The moon glows bright in your sight
A silvery crescent in the night
A beacon in the dark of space
A gentle light that shines with gentle pace

Its phases mark the passage of time
From new to full, a constant rhyme
A symbol of magic in the sky
A beauty that touches hearts as they fly

In the stillness of the midnight hour
The moon's soft light is a peaceful power
A guiding force

A silver crescent, shining high.

A beacon in the darkness, as it glows.
