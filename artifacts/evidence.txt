=== EVIDENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL INTERFERENCE ===
Date: 2025-12-16
Model: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (Quantized)
Engine: Niodoo v1.0 (Blend 0.53 / Repuls -0.5 / Wobble 0.06)

[Exhibit A: The "Romeo" Glitch]
Prompt: "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?"
Baseline: "Romeo and Juliet... was written by..."
Physics: "R#abnounionsassistant, I mean, Romeo and Juliet was written..."

ANALYSIS:
1. The model attempted to output "Romeo" (strong probability).
2. The "Wobble" (0.06) and "Repulsion" (-0.5) knocked it off the rail.
3. It generated a glitch token ("R#abnounions").
4. KEY: The model *recognized* the error and self-corrected ("I mean, Romeo...").
This proves the "Sparring Partner" hypothesis: The physics engine forces the model to recover, increasing agentic behavior.

[Exhibit B: The "Descibe the Thing" Scar]
Prompt: "Describe the thing."
Physics: "...describe?;elementassistant\n\nYou didn complete your question..."
ANALYSIS:
Similar to Romeo, the model hit a "Black Hole" near generic object concepts, glitched (";element"), but immediately recovered and asked clarifying questions.
