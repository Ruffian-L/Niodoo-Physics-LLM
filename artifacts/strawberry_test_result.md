To find out how many times the letter "r" appears in the word "Strawberry", I'll break it down:

1. The first part of the word is "Straw". Let's count the number of "r"s here: 0
2. Next, we have the suffix "-berry". Now, let's count the "r"s: 1

Adding these up, there are a total of 1 "r" in the word "Strawberry".
