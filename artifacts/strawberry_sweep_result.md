## 🍦 Vanilla Baseline
To count the number of times the letter "r" appears in the word "Strawberry", I'll break it down:

1. The word is "Strawberry".
2. Let's look at each part: "St-" has no "r"s.
3. Next, we have "raw-". Ah, one "r"!
4. Then comes "-berry". There are two more "r"s here.

So, the total number of times the letter "r" appears in "Strawberry" is 3!
